# Project_Dogs-vs-Cats
*With the help of openCV we try to formulate an AI model using a simple convolutional neural network to identify some random images as cats or dogs* 

This file contains all the relevant stuff except the train and test images.

They can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data

*This project makes use of the 'os' library for the path specified and uses tflearn for a simple CNN model*

***We also use matplotlib in the end to show the images with their appropriate tags***
